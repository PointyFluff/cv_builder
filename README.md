# cv_builder
# WIP

cv_builder is a builder-pattern library in Rust for building out CVs, programmatically, in rust. 

Written to aid myself and my catharsis.

Very much a Work in Progress. 

### ToDo:
 - Serialze data structures
 - Yaml data storage
 - Markdown output
 - Documentation
 - Proper unit tests
